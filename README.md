  ## Usage
  Open the client folder on the command-line and enter "npm i" to install all the packages. Then enter "npm start" to start the client-side server. Do the same for the server folder. Next open up the browser and enter "localhost:3000" which will direct you to the application. Finally, for the single-page application to work, click on Install! at the top left corner of the page. That'll download the JATE application and once opened, a single-page JATE application will pop up out of the browser.
